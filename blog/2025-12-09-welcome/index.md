Welcome to my blog! This blog is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a react-based static site generator that can generate pages from markdown. I write all my notes/thoughts/writeups in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (thanks [Nate](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nate-dunlap) and [Landon](https://kalipatriot.net)), so this platform seemed like a great option.

On this blog, I will primarily be writing about whatever projects, competitions, or just cool things in general I participate in. You might see writeups of retired [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) labs, writeups of cool CTF challenges I come across, or just documentation for projects I'm working on. Enjoy your stay!
